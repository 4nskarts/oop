Using super() in Child Classes

In object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like Python, it's important to understand the usage of super() when working with inheritance. When you have a child class that inherits from a parent class, calling super() within the child class constructor (or method) is crucial for proper initialization and maintaining the integrity of your object-oriented design.
Why Use super()?
1. Initialization of Parent Class

When you create an instance of a child class, super() is used to call the constructor of the parent class. This ensures that any necessary initialization defined in the parent class constructor is executed before the initialization of the child class.
2. Inheritance of Attributes and Methods

Calling super() allows the child class to inherit attributes and behaviors from the parent class. By invoking the parent class constructor, the child class can set up any inherited properties or behaviors defined in the parent class.
3. Avoiding Duplicate Code

If the parent class has important setup tasks in its constructor, calling super() from the child class ensures that these tasks are performed without duplicating the initialization code in the child class constructor.
4. Maintaining Object Integrity

Object initialization can sometimes involve complex logic, especially when dealing with inheritance. By calling super() first, you ensure that the base object (parent class) is properly set up before customizing it in the child class.

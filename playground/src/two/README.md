### Lesson: Visibility Rules When Overriding Methods in Java

In Java, when overriding methods from a superclass or implementing methods from interfaces, there are specific rules governing visibility (access level) modifications. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Increasing Visibility**:
   - You can increase visibility (make a method more accessible) when overriding methods. For example, you can override a `protected` method with a `public` method in a subclass.

2. **Maintaining or Same Visibility**:
   - You can maintain the same visibility or increase visibility, but you cannot reduce visibility (make a method less accessible) when overriding methods. This means if a superclass method is `public`, you can override it with `public` in the subclass.

3. **Decreasing Visibility (Not Allowed)**:
   - Decreasing visibility when overriding methods is not allowed in Java. For instance, you cannot override a `public` method with a `protected` or `private` method in a subclass. This restriction ensures adherence to the principle of subclass substitutability and prevents unexpected behavior or compilation errors.

Understanding and applying these visibility rules when designing class hierarchies and implementing interfaces in Java helps maintain code integrity and promotes predictable behavior within your software architecture.
